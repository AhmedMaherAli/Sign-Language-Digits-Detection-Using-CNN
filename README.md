# Sign-Language-Digits-Detection-Using-convolutional-neural-network

# To run this proect:</br>
-You need to instal keras and sklearn, running it on google colab is preferable.


# Description</br>

-In this project i use Convolutional Neural Network to make the detection process,</br> 
-I made 4 models and after each one calculate the acuracy to see which model works better.</br>
-The first two i uses the images data set as gray images one of them runs on 3 layers and the other runs on 6 layers.</br>
-The other two i uses the images as RGB one model with 3 layers and the other runs on 6 layers.</br>
